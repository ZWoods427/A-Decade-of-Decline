        <p>According to the American Civil Liberties Union, the United States has the highest number of youth incarcerations than any other country. Over the course of ten years the number of juvenile arrests have slowly declined from its peak in the early 1990s. Some experts attribute the decrease in youth arrests to the approach to criminal justice reform and the Juvenile Justice Reform Act of 2018 being signed into law in December 2018 and others credit the rise of programs that offer prevention and early intervention opportunities for youth and teens who show patterns of behaviors that may result in future arrests. "I believe it is the correlation between the [revised] Stop and Frisk policies and the approach to criminal justice reform," Amina Woods, LMSW said when asked about the change in numbers. Woods is an on site mental health clinician at a middle and high school hybrid in Queens, NY. Her caseload consists of at risk youth who may or may not have already had encounters with the juvenile justice system. They are referred to her for intervention and alternative services.
